My job is writing user interfaces, getting backend to deliver dummy shit

The dummy shit will be in the form of the classes written by Andre

Therefore I need to:

    * Write barebones HTML templates with appropriate stuff and appropriate Controller classes
    * Create the Database Encapsulation class (needs me to be collaborating with Andre's classes)

For the IndexController:
    Don't bother with logins. We need to get a minimum of the admin staff page
    to be available.

    We won't require an actual proper login. We .permitAll() on anyRequest().

    It will immediately redirect to /home upon clicking on the login button,
    regardless of the details. It will fix the user details for that "session",
    i.e. whenever we are saying "welcome, [username]", username is a fixed
    value.
